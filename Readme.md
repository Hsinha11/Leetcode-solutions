## 🎉 Contribution Guidelines for Hacktoberfest 🎉

We’re thrilled to invite you to be part of the **LeetCode Solutions** community during Hacktoberfest! Your contributions will not only enhance this repository but also help fellow coders in their journey. 🎉

### 📝 Contribution Rules:
1. **Star the Repository ⭐**: Show your enthusiasm by starring this repository before making any Pull Requests (PRs) or forking it.
2. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy to make changes and enhancements.
3. **Adhere to LeetCode's Problem Numbering**: When adding a solution, name the file using the **exact problem title** and **number** (e.g., `1_Two_Sum.py`) for consistency and clarity.
4. **Solution Format**:
   - Include a brief yet insightful explanation or comments within your code to illuminate your thought process.
   - While Python is the primary language, we welcome contributions in C++, Java, and other programming languages.
5. **Quality Over Quantity**: Prioritize well-optimized, tested solutions. Code that fails to meet standards will be returned for revisions.
6. **No Duplicate Solutions**: Before submitting, ensure that a solution for the specific problem does not already exist. If it does, aim to provide an optimized or alternative solution.
7. **Hacktoberfest Participation**: Make meaningful contributions! Please refrain from submitting irrelevant or spammy PRs aimed solely at increasing your Hacktoberfest count—such submissions will be marked as invalid.
