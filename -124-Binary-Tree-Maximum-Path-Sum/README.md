## [Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum)
![Difficulty: Hard](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

<hr>
<p>
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can appear only once in the sequence. The path does not need to go through the root.<br>
Given the <code>root</code> of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any path.
</p>

### Example 1:
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [1,2,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3.
</pre>

### Constraints:
- <code>The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>
- <code>-1000 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 1000</code>
