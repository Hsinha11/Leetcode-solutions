### 3349. Adjacent Increasing Subarrays Detection I (Easy)

Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, determine whether there exist
two adjacent subarrays of length k such that both are strictly increasing.

**Approach:** Check each subarray of length k and its adjacent subarray.  
**Complexity:** Time O(n), Space O(1)
