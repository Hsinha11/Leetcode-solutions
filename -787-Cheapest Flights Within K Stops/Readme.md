## Problem Statement : 
#### Problem Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/description/
There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.

You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.

Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
Output: 700
Explanation:
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.

Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
Output: 200
Explanation:
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city

Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
Output: 500
Explanation:
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with no stops from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 500.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100
0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)
flights[i].length == 3
0 <= fromi, toi < n
fromi != toi
1 <= pricei <= 104
There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
0 <= src, dst, k < n
src != dst

## ðŸ§  Approach

We use a **BFS-based shortest path algorithm** (similar to Bellman-Ford) to find the cheapest price from `src` to `dst` with at most `k` stops.  
1. Build an adjacency list from the `flights` array where each entry stores `(destination, cost)`.  
2. Use a queue to perform **level-order traversal**, where each level represents one stop.  
3. Maintain a `dist` array to record the minimum cost to reach each node.  
4. For each node, relax all adjacent edges if a cheaper route is found and push the updated state into the queue.  
5. After traversing up to `k` levels, return the minimum cost to reach `dst`, or `-1` if unreachable.

## ðŸ§© Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(E * K), where E = number of flights  
- **Space Complexity:** O(N + E), for adjacency list and distance array
